This final year project focuses on the design and development of a web-based healthcare management platform built on a microservices architecture.
The platform connects key healthcare stakeholders — patients, doctors, and insurance providers — within a secure, collaborative, and scalable digital ecosystem.

Doctors can manage and share patients’ medical records in PDF format, track consultations, and automatically send billing information to insurance providers for reimbursement processing.
Patients can securely access their medical records, review their medical history, and track the status of reimbursement requests in real time.

From a technical perspective, the system is composed of multiple Spring Boot microservices communicating via REST APIs and secured through JWT authentication.
The frontend, developed with React.js, provides a dynamic and user-friendly interface.

The project also integrates a complete DevOps pipeline, including Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring and visualization.
This approach ensures automation, scalability, and high availability of all microservices.
